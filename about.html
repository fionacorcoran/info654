            <p>The Ad Meliora Project is a subsidiary of <span class="glow_text">Ad Meliora Press</span>, a publisher of neo-Hermeneutic, Elektro-Theosophical texts and genre fiction. Founded in New York City in 1904, Ad Meliora Press was originally founded as the publisher of a quarterly journal called <span class="glow_text"><i>Hidden Light</i></span>, dedicated to discussion of Theosophical concepts. Rejected by both mainstream and neo-Theosophists, contributors to <span class="glow_text"><i>Hidden Light</i></span> formed their own corpus of beliefs and practices which would eventually become known as <span class="glow_text">Elektro-Theosophy</span>. Many of their assertions, founded on knowledge revealed through visions and messages from higher entities, would later find grounding with the invention of computing. In response to declining circulation figures in the 1930s and under the editorship of <span class="glow_text">Ama Nuensis</span>, Ad Meliora Press expanded its offerings to include detective serials, leading to its first commercial successes outside of occult publishing circles. <span class="glow_text"><i>The Ditsy Tulane Capers</i></span> were knockout hits for Ad Meliora's Twice Right Mysteries imprint and the proceeds allowed them to expand their nonfiction operations.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><span class="glow_text"><i>A Broken Clock is Twice Right</i> (1936)</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Technically a Delmore Vance adventure, this is the first appearance of Ditsy Tulane as a character. Her runaway popularity was fueled by the 1937 radio play adaptation where she was voiced by Pauline Beller and swiftly spawned a series of Ditsy Tulane pulp adventures that were later traditionally published by Twice Right Mysteries.</li>
                        </ul>    
                    </li> 
                    <li><span class="glow_text"><i>Ditsy Tulane and the Poisoned Girdle</i> (1937)</span></li>
                    <li><span class="glow_text"><i>Ditsy Tulane and the Green Mask</i>(1938)</span></li>
                    <li><span class="glow_text"><i>Ditsy Tulane and the Harvard Case</i>(1938)</span> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Notable as the first appearance of Ditsy's sidekick, Francine "Fishy" Delmar.</li>
                        </ul> 
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="glow_text"><i>Ditsy Tulane and the Hidden Light</i> (1939)</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This was an ill-conceived attempt by the editor of Ad Meliora Press, Ama Nuensis, to bring Elektro-Theosophy to a wider audience using the Ditsy Tulane mysteries as a vessel, much like how one disguises vegetables in pasta sauce or heartworm medication inside peanut butter. Audience condemnation was swift and decisive.</li>

                    </li>
                    <li><span class="glow_text"><i>Ditsy Tulane Always Gets Her Man</i>(1940)</span></li>
                    <li><span class="glow_text"><i>Ditsy Tulane and the Ridgemont Strangler</i>(1941)</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The outbreak of war with Japan and Germany led to a pause in the publication of Ditsy Tulane mysteries and a steep drop in revenue for Ad Meliora Press. Ditsy Tulane remained on the back burner until 1943, when Twice Right Mysteries rebranded her as an international Nazi-hunter.</li>
