            <p>The Ad Meliora Project is a subsidiary of <span class="glow_text">Ad Meliora Press</span>, a publisher of neo-Hermeneutic, Elektro-Theosophic texts and genre fiction. Founded in New York City in 1904, Ad Meliora Press was originally founded as the publisher of a quarterly journal called <span class="glow_text"><i>Hidden Light</i></span>, dedicated to discussion of Theosophical concepts. Rejected by both mainstream and neo-Theosophists, contributors to <span class="glow_text"><i>Hidden Light</i></span> formed their own corpus of beliefs and practices which would eventually become known as <span class="glow_text">Elektro-Theosophy</span>. Many of their assertions, founded on knowledge revealed through visions and messages from higher entities, would later find grounding with the invention of computing. In response to declining circulation figures in the 1930s and under the editorship of <span class="glow_text">Ama Nuensis</span>, Ad Meliora Press expanded its offerings to include detective serials, leading to its first commercial successes outside of occult publishing circles. <span class="glow_text"><i>The Ditsy Tulane Capers</i></span> were knockout hits for Ad Meliora's Twice Right Mysteries imprint and the proceeds allowed them to expand their nonfiction operations.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><i>A Broken Clock is Twice Right</i> 1936
                        <li>Technically a Delmore Vance adventure, this is the first appearance of Ditsy Tulane as a character. Her runaway popularity was fueled by the 1937 radio play adaptation where she was voiced by Pauline Beller and swiftly spawned a series of Ditsy Tulane pulp adventures that were later traditionally published by Twice Right Mysteries.</li>
