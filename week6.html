   <h1>It's Week 6!</h1>
   <h2>You know what that means, kids.</h2>
   <p>It's time to make a very basic website using the very limited HTML that we know. 
    It's a very special time in every coder's life, when you can count the amount of tags you know how to use on your two hands.</p>
   <p>Here's a list, just to prove I can do one:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>things</li>
    <li>stuff
        <li>objects</li>
        <li>concepts</li>
    </li>
    <li>etc.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Fascinating!</h2>
        <p>By now, you're desperately wondering what the creator of this website looks like.</p>
        <p>"Who is this aloof and mysterious genius?" you cry. "Wherefore do they hide their visage? Horribly scarred perhaps?"</p>
        <p>Surmise no longer, dear, gentle, nosy reader. Refer to the artist's rendering below.</p>
