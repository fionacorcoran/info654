            <p>There are <span class="glow_text">portals</span> in the worn places of the world. In the spaces where the fabric <span class="glow_text">thins</span> from use. They are hard to see with the untrained eye, even harder to capture without disrupting their nature. The internet is the single greatest source of these phenomena, a nexus of <span class="glow_text">links</span> that only occasionally lead the user to their expected destination.</p>
            <p>Using experimental <span class="glow_text">portal capture</span> technology, we are proud to present <span class="glow_text">six</span> stable class-M <span class="glow_text">digi-portals</span> in a secure OBSL-4 environment.</p>
            <p>Though class-M manifestations seldom occupy the visible spectrum, our scientists have successfully translated their <span class="glow_text">base frequencies</span> into hex code. The images below are representational and only tangentially indicative of what awaits on the other side of the <span class="glow_text">portal</span>. Early attempts at deriving an auditory manifestation of the digi-portals led to <span class="glow_text">mass casualties</span> and an upgrade from OBSL-3 facilities*.</p>
            <p>The upper left portal (Portal A) has shifted destination post-capture and now outputs an "About" page with information about the <span class="glow text">Ad Meliora Project</span> and its origins. Unnervingly, we have no record of this page's existence prior to digi-capture of <span class="glow_text">Portal A</span>. Perhaps it wants us to know that is aware, and watching us even as we watch it.</p>
            <p>As always, the user proceeds at their own risk when entering a <span class="glow_text">digi-portal</span>. The AMP disavows liability for any immediate or foreshadowed consequences of digi-portal travel and does not acknowledge the legal authority of <span class="glow_text">any</span> governing body. We are travelers on a <span class="glow_text">higher road</span>.</p>
            <p>*We are currently <span class="glow_text">hiring</span> for our A/V team and are pleased to offer a comprehensive benefits package including <span class="glow_text">short-term</span> life insurance.</p>
