        <h2 class="glow_text">Messages to the future</h2>
        <p>The <a href="https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1279277/m2/1/high_res_d/10117359.pdf">1993 report</a> from Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico identifies seven (7) basic principles for speaking to the future:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the site must be marked,</li>
            <li>message(s) must be truthful and informative,</li>
            <li>multiple components within a marker system,</li>
            <li>multiple means of communication (e.g., language, pictographs, scientific diagrams),</li>
            <li>multiple levels of complexity within individual messages on individual marker system elements,</li>
            <li>use of materials with little recycle value;</li>
            <li>and international effort to maintain knowledge of the locations and contents of nuclear waste repositories.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Perhaps at this point it is worth mentioning that this report does not concern just any message to the future, but one sent in hopes of warning away our unsuspecting descendants [replacements(?), survivors(?)] from nuclear waste sites with the assumption that so much time has passed that it is highly unlikely we and they will share a language or set of commonly understood symbols.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="glow_box">
            <p>Multiple teams of experts were assembled to confront the problem of safe nuclear waste disposal. Team A created this message:</p>
            <p><i>This place is a message...and part of a system of messages...pay attention to it! </i></p>
            <p><i>Sending this message was important to us. We considered ourselves to be a powerful culture. </i></p>
            <p><i>This place is not a place of honor...no highly esteemed deed is commemorated here...nothing valued is here.</i></p>
            <p><i>What is here was dangerous and repulsive to us. This message is a warning about danger. </i></p>
            <p><i>The danger is in a particular location...it increases towards a center...the center of danger is here...of a particular size and shape, and below us.</i></p>
            <p><i>The danger is still present, in your time, as it was in our.s</i></p>
            <p><i>The danger is to the body, and it can kill.</i></p>
            <p><i>The form of the danger is an emanation of energy. </i></p>
            <p><i>The danger is unleashed only if you substantially disturb this place physically. This place is best shunned and left uninhabited. </i></p>
        </div>
        <div class="glow_box">
            <p>To devote today's resources to the question of tomorrow's health is a controversial act. To stretch our hands out the length of 10,000 years borders on heroic, or heroicly absurd. Will these denizens of tomorrow have eyes to read our message or minds equipped to understand it? If we were not operating under the assumption that we would recognize something of ourselves in them, would we care to safeguard their well-being? Do the lidless crab-creatures of the year 12025 warrant our protection?</p>
